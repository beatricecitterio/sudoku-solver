    "# __Sudoku Solver__ using Genetic Algorithms\n",
    "Using genetic algorithms to solve sudokus has several limitations. In fact, these methods often struggle to find the real solution. The goal of this project is to compare the performances of different variants of genetic algorithms. In particular, I will start with a straightforward approach (tournament selection, basic crossover and mutations) to tackle small sudoku grids (such as 4x4 and 6x6). Then, I will consider a harder version of the problem, i.e. solving 9x9 grids. It will be immediately clear that the basic approach previously used will fail to find solutions. Thus, I will explore different variants, by trying several selection methods and exploring the parameter space, and see how the performance changes.\n"

    "## __Conclusions__\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, genetic algorithms are not the best approach to solve sudokus, as it has been broadly explored in literature. As a matter of fact, the goal of this project was not to build an efficient solver, rather to try and understand what improvements could be made to get closer to finding a solution and to explore different parameters and methods to see how they influence the final outcome.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, with this brief analysis, we have been able to solve easy enough puzzles (i.e. either 4x4 and 6x6 grids or 9x9 grids close enough to the solution), we have seen that typically tournament selection works better than the other approaches and that for harder puzzles genetic algorithms tend to get stuck at some suboptimal value. In principle, one could think that the algorithm gets stuck at a local minimum and can't get out of it. However, even employing extremely high mutation rates, which should help the algorithm explore the solution space as much as possible, the result's don't change. Thus, this might be a problem caused by the intrinsic structure of the puzzles, or by how we defined the framework. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite having obtained some successful results, further improvements could be done on this analysis. For example, one could add adaptive mutation rate or change crossover rate. In particular, we could also try different types of crossover or different types of mutations. Finally, different representation of sudoku grids could be employed to see if that affects the performance as well."
